<p><strong>Core Memory Music</strong> is looking for soloists and small ensembles to perform in our chamber
music series. We want to showcase your artistry and provide our audience with a rich, varied
mix of music each season.</p>

<p>Our concerts take place inside a <a href="this-new-house.html">modern home</a> in southern Rhode
Island, a few miles from the Atlantic coast. The performance space seats up to 30 people and
features a Steinway concert grand in excellent condition. Concerts are informal and we
encourage performers to interact with the audience. We provide meals, lodging, and ground
transportation while you’re here, and we’ll help with your travel expenses.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pages/performance-space.png" alt="Performance Space" class="center" /></p>

<p>If this opportunity interests you, please <a href="mailto:craig@corememorymusic.com?subject=Artist%20Inquiry">introduce yourself</a>. If you
don’t have a website, include your bio or CV and links to some of your recent recordings. If
your proposal interests us and seems likely to appeal to our audience, we’ll reach out and
ask you to schedule a phone meeting.</p>

<p id="alt-shaded-box">
NOTE: We are currently booking artists for the 2025-2026 concert season.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4 id="how-long-should-i-perform">How long should I perform?</h4>

<p>Please prepare a minimum of 60 minutes of music. Most of our concerts are divided into two
segments with a 15-minute intermission. Encores are optional but much appreciated by our
audience.</p>

<h4 id="when-do-i-submit-my-concert-program">When do I submit my concert program?</h4>

<p>Three months ahead of your concert date, we’ll ask for your proposed program. If we think
the program needs to be revised, we’ll explain why and suggest some possible changes. After
we agree on the program, we’ll send you a 
<a href="/assets/documents/agreement.pdf" type="application/pdf">performance agreement</a>
 to review and sign.</p>

<h4 id="where-is-the-concert-venue">Where is the concert venue?</h4>

<p>The address of the venue is <strong>103 North Road, Wakefield, Rhode Island 02879</strong>. Driving time
from Providence, Newport, Westerly, and southeastern Connecticut is under an hour,
and Amtrak’s <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/stations/kin" title="Kingston Station">Kingston Station</a> is only five miles away.</p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/g77318Ud2csumT9h7" title="Map and Directions">Map and Directions</a></p>

<h4 id="when-should-i-arrive">When should I arrive?</h4>

<p>Please plan to arrive at least two hours before your performance is scheduled to begin. If
you’re traveling several hours to get here, please plan to arrive on the day before your
concert. We’re happy to provide lodging at the venue for up to two nights.</p>

<h4 id="will-my-concert-be-recorded">Will my concert be recorded?</h4>

<p>If you would like us to make an audio recording of your concert, please let us know in
advance. We have a simple two-mic system that works best for soloists but can be used for
ensembles as well. The quality is suitable for private use. All recordings belong to the
artist.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-ever-postpone-or-cancel-concerts">Do you ever postpone or cancel concerts?</h4>

<p>If we don’t get enough advance reservations, we may decide to cancel your concert. If that
happens, we’ll pay you one-half of your performance fee. The balance is paid if and when the
concert takes place at a later date.</p>

<h4 id="where-can-i-find-publicity-about-my-concert">Where can I find publicity about my concert?</h4>

<p>The most reliable source of concert information is the <a href="schedule.html">concert schedule</a> on our
website.</p>
