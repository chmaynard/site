<h2 id="about-the-artists">About the Artists</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.tekalliduo.com">Tekalli Duo</a> has performed internationally across the
Americas and overseas, leaving audiences breathless by their depth of individual technical
mastery as well as their shared musical intuition. Highly versatile in their performing
capacities, Tekalli Duo has appeared as duo soloists with orchestra, recitalists, educators,
and American musical ambassadors abroad. Their diverse ethnic background greatly influences
their passion to connect the world through the language of music.</p>

<p>In March 2014, Tekalli Duo performed the Mendelssohn Double Concerto with La Orquesta
Sinfónica de la Universidad de Guanajuato in Mexico, which was broadcasted on Radio
Universidad de Guanajuato. Their recitals have been presented by Concert Artists Guild in
NYC, as well as the Odeon and Woodbridge Chamber Series. They gave the Canadian premiere of
Michael Brown’s Violin Sonata, which they commissioned, as well as Suliman Tekalli’s
transcription of Ravel’s Le tombeau de Couperin at the Banff Centre. Tekalli Duo has also
lead masterclasses at the University of Tampa. Under the auspices of the United States
Embassy as a musical exchange of Western and Middle Eastern music, Tekalli Duo appeared as
performers in pre-revolutionary Libya at the University of Tripoli. In the fall of 2015,
they performed a recital live on WFMT radio in Chicago as part of the Dame Myra Hess
Memorial Concerts.</p>

<p>Tekalli Duo’s repertoire includes the duo concerto and sonata repertory of the classics
through romantic, 20th century and contemporary periods. Their recitals invariably mix
standard classical repertory with newer works by composers of their heritage such as Fazil
Say and Takemitsu, as well as their own transcriptions of classical and contemporary music.</p>
