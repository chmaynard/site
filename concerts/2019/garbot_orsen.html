<h3 id="brandon-garbot">Brandon Garbot</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/brandon_garbot.png" alt="Brandon Garbot" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Violinist Brandon Garbot has appeared in solo and chamber performances in venues such as
Carnegie’s Weill Recital Hall, Severance Hall, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Hall, the
Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg, the Kennedy Center, and in Tainan, Taiwan. He has soloed with
the Oregon Symphony, Jefferson Symphony, and on tour with the Curtis Chamber Orchestra.</p>

<p>Mr. Garbot has been a guest musician with The Philadelphia Orchestra and the Saint Paul
Chamber Orchestra. He has performed and collaborated with members the Artemis and Belcea
Quartets, as well as Shmuel Ashkenasi, Timothy Eddy, Viviane Hagner, Hsin-Yun Huang, Kim
Kashkashian, Steven Tenenbom, and Jason Vieaux. He has performed at Music@Menlo, Ravinia,
Krzyzowa-Music Festival, Perlman Music Program, Rheingau Musik Festival, and Festspiele
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</p>

<p>Mr. Garbot’s performances have been featured on APM’s Performance Today and WHYY’s On Stage
at Curtis. Brandon Garbot recently graduated from the Curtis Insti- tute of Music as a
student of Ida Kavafian and Arnold Steinhardt. He has previously studied with Catherine Cho,
Itzhak Perlman, and William Preucil.</p>

<h3 id="daniel-orsen">Daniel Orsen</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/daniel_orsen.png" alt="Daniel Orsen" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Violist Daniel Orsen is based in Boston, Massachusetts. This season, Daniel will play a
series of concerts as guest solo violist of the Arctic Philharmonic Sinfonietta in Bodø,
Norway. He also frequently performs as a substitute violist with the Philadelphia Orchestra
and Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and on various concert series in the Boston area.</p>

<p>As a chamber musician, Daniel has performed along side artists such as Itzhak Perlman, Kim
Kashkashian, Donald Weilerstein, and the Jasper String Quartet. His flute-viola-harp trio,
OWL riot, was selected as a 2018 NEC Honors Ensemble. Festival credits include Kryzyzowa
Music, Ravinia Steeans Music Institute, IMS Prussia Cove, and the Perlman Music Program.</p>

<p>As soloist, Daniel has performed with Oberlin’s Contemporary Music Ensemble and the
Pittsburgh Civic Orchestra, and is a first prize winner of the ASTA National Solo
Competition.</p>

<p>Daniel has a few silly arrangements and transcriptions to his name, including his
“Fledermaus Fantasy” for viola and piano, and a five-viola version of Weber’s “Andante et
Rondo Ungarese.”</p>

<p>A native of Pittsburgh, PA, Daniel began performing on percussion at three years of age, had
a disastrous encounter with the piano at age five, and started the viola at age eight-and
for some reason, probably Beethoven’s string quartets, it stuck. He received his BM from
Oberlin studying with Peter Slowik, and MM from New England Conservatory studying with Kim
Kashkashian.</p>
