<p>Praised as “especially impressive” and “a thoughtful, sensitive performer” who “balanced lyrical
warmth and crisp clarity”(Tommasini–The New York Times), pianist Zhu Wang was awarded First Prize in
the 2020 Young Concert Artists Susan Wadsworth International Auditions. In 2019, Zhu was finalist in
the Clara Haskil International Piano Competition, and he has been a featured soloist on WQXR’s Young
Artist Showcase and WFMT’s Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concerts. The world-renowned pianist Fou Ts’ong
recognized Zhu as an “excellent pianist with a natural sense of harmony and imagination,” whose
sensitive and engaging performances exhibit a remarkable depth of musicianship and poise beyond his
age. His Carnegie Hall debut made The New York Times’“Best of Classical Music 2021” list.</p>

<p>In the 2023-2024 season, Zhu will appear in recitals and chamber music series at Southbank Center in
London, Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, Caramoor in New York, and appearing as soloist with New York
Youth Symphony at Carnegie Hall, Kansas City, Memphis, Fort Collins, and Spokane Symphony
Orchestras.</p>

<p>Zhu has performed in China, Korea, Italy, Poland, Japan, and across the US at prestigious venues
including the Kennedy Center, Kammermusiksaal of Berliner Philharmonie, Warsaw Philharmonic Concert
Hall, Shanghai Concert Hall, Chicago Cultural Center, and The Morgan Library &amp; Museum. Since his
orchestral debut at age 14 with the Hilton Head Symphony Orchestra, where he performed Mozart Piano
Concerto No. 21, Zhu has also appeared as soloist with Fort Worth Symphony, Columbus Symphony,
Brevard Sinfonia, Salzburg Chamber Soloists, Zermatt Festival Orchestra and Xiamen Philharmonic
Orchestra.</p>

<p>An active chamber musician and champion of new music, Zhu had premiered works by John Corigliano,
Timo Andres, Zhou Tian, Eric Ewazen, Steven Banks, Nina Shekhar and Alistair Coleman. He had
appeared as a chamber musician at festivals and series such as Chamber Music Society of Lincoln
Center, Bridgehampton, La Jolla, PCMS, 92nd Street Y, Music@Menlo, Caramoor, Bravo Vail, Kneisel,
and Four Seasons. Zhu had collaborated with artists including Ida Kavafian, David Shifrin, Orion
String Quartet, Annie-Marie McDermott and Wu Han.</p>

<p>A native of Hunan, China, Zhu started learning piano at the age of five. He is a graduate of the
 Music Middle School Affiliated to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, where he studied with Zhe
 Tang and Fou Ts’ong.  He received a Bachelor of Music degree from The Juilliard School,
 post-baccalaureate diploma at Curtis Institute of Music. He is the recipient of the Gina Bachauer
 and Mieczyslaw Munz Scholarship at Juilliard, and the recipient of the Mehlin Prize at Curtis. Zhu
 is currently pursuing his Master of Music degree, under the tutelage of Robert McDonald and Emanuel
 Ax. He gratefully acknowledges the support of the Bagby Foundation for the Musical Arts.</p>
