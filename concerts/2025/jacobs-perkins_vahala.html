<h3 id="annie-jacobs-perkins">Annie Jacobs-Perkins</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/annie_jacobs-perkins.png" alt="Annie Jacobs-Perkins" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Praised for anything from “hypnotic lyricism, causing listeners to forget where they were for a
moment” (Alex Ross, The New Yorker) to “delightfully pluck[ing] and slapp[ing] her cello like a
rockabilly upright bassist” (The Democrat and Chronicle), cellist Annie Jacobs-Perkins is known for
“eras[ing] all kinds of boundaries” (USC Thornton School of Music) with her music.</p>

<p>Annie is the recent winner of the 2023 Pierre Fournier Award. In the coming seasons she will present
a recital in Wigmore Hall, perform as soloist with London’s Philharmonia Orchestra, and record a
debut album on the Champs Hill label. Annie is also 1st prize winner of the Chamber Orchestra of the
Springs Emerging Soloist Competition, New England Conservatory Concerto Competition, and
Hennings-Fischer Young Artist Competition. She will begin her roles as Artist-in-Residence of the
Austin Chamber Music Center and EstOvest Festival Contemporary Cello Week this fall. In 2021 she was
also chosen to be Young-Artist-in-Residence at NPR’s Performance Today.</p>

<p>Annie is principal cellist of Joshua Weilerstein’s Phoenix Chamber Orchestra in Boston and cellist
of Trio Brontë, 1st prize winners of the 2023 Ilmari Hannikainen International Piano Chamber Music
Competition in Finland. She has performed at venues such as the Library of Congress, Het
Concertgebouw, Jordan Hall, Carnegie Hall, Berlin Konzerthaus, Berliner Philharmonie, Ravinia Steans
Institute, Krzyzowa Music, Yellow Barn Festival, and La Jolla Music Society’s SummerFest.</p>

<p>After winning the Father Merlet Award from the Pro Musicis Foundation in 2022, Annie commissioned
composers Stratis Minakakis and Daniel Temkin to write two works for cello and piano responding to
the climate crisis. Her passion for new music has led her to work with composers Brett Dean, Jörg
Widmann, Timo Andres, Jeffrey Mumford, Konstantia Gourzi, and Jessie Montgomery.</p>

<p>Annie is currently working towards an Artist Diploma at the Barenboim-Said Academy in Berlin. She
previously studied at the Hochschule für Musik Hanns Eisler Berlin (MM ‘23, Ottilie-Selbach-Redslob
Stiftung scholarship), New England Conservatory (MM ‘20 and GD ‘21, Laurence Lesser Presidential
Scholarship), and USC’s Thornton School of Music (BM ‘18, Outstanding Graduate Award and Trustee
Scholar). Her primary teachers include Frans Helmerson, Troels Svane, Laurence Lesser, Ralph
Kirshbaum, and Kathleen Murphy Kemp. Other influential teachers include Guy Fishman, David Geringas,
Geoff Dyer, and Thomas Gustafson.</p>

<p>Annie spends her free time foraging for indigenous edible plants, relearning the history of the
United States from the perspective of BIPOC, feminist, and LGBTQ+ communities, pretending to be a
dog with her dogs Georgie and Farley, and adoring her nephews Charlie and Robin.</p>

<h3 id="katelyn-vahala">Katelyn Vahala</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/katelyn_vahala.png" alt="Katelyn Vahala" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Praised as a “highly accomplished pianist with wonderfully rhythmic and robust playing” (New York
Concert Review), Katelyn Vahala is a passionate soloist, chamber musician, educator, and arts
advocate in the Los Angeles area.</p>

<p>As Artistic Director and Co-Founder of the traveling outdoor concert series Insert Music Here,
Katelyn brings carefully curated musical programs outside the concert hall and into nature – most
recently through partnerships with the Eaton Canyon Nature Center, Ojai Valley Land Conservancy, and
LA Times Festival of Books. Insert Music Here presents concerts in scenic locations with a hybrid
grand piano and unique portable stage to expand access to the arts for new communities while
supporting awareness for environmental conservation organizations.</p>

<p>In addition to winning the 2021 USC Thornton Concerto Competition, Katelyn is the first prize winner
of the 2019 Rosalyn Tureck International Bach Competition, where she also won the contemporary music
award. Upon completing her Masters degree, she was named a 2018 Outstanding Graduate at the
University of Southern California’s Thornton School of Music. Katelyn’s upcoming engagements include
performances in Leipzig as a Semifinalist in the Leipzig International Bach Competition, taking
place in July 2022.</p>

<p>One of Katelyn’s greatest passions is chamber music. As pianist of the Callisto Piano Trio, Katelyn
was a prize winner at the 2016 Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition, where the trio was the
youngest ensemble to ever compete in the senior division finals. Since then, the Callisto Trio has
toured throughout Holland and Slovakia as part of the International Holland Music Sessions’ Masters
on Tour and has served as Artist-in-Residence at the Da Camera Society in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Katelyn has performed in Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Het Concertgebouw, Salzburg Mozarteum,
Bratislava Reduta Philharmonic Hall, St. Petersburg Union of Composers, Porto Casa da Música, and
LACMA’s Bing Auditorium. Her past collaborations include performances with artists from the
Juilliard and American String Quartets, as well as appearances with the Tandru Trio and the Julius
Quartet. She has attended the Yellow Barn Young Artists Program, Perlman Music Program, Colburn
Academy Piano Festival, and Port Townsend Chamber Music Workshop. Previous chamber music mentors
include Ralph Kirshbaum, Seth Knopp, Itzhak Perlman, Roger Tapping, and Andrew Cook.</p>

<p>A recipient of the Heartwell Endowed Scholarship, Katelyn is pursuing a DMA in Piano Performance at
USC’s Thornton School of Music with Dr. Lucinda Carver and Jeffrey Kahane. She completed her
Bachelors and Masters degrees in Piano Performance at USC, in which she was a Trustee Scholar.</p>
