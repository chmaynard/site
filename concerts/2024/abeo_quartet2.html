<p>Formed at Juilliard in 2018, the <a href="https://www.abeoquartet.com">Abeo Quartet</a> was the
inaugural Graduate String Quartet in Residence at the University of Delaware under the
mentorship of the Calidore String Quartet.</p>

<p>Abeo’s recent accomplishments include winning Third Prize at the 2023 Bad Tölz International
String Quartet Competition and being among ten quartets invited to participate in the 14th
Banff International String Quartet Competition in 2022.  The quartet was also a First Prize
and Audience Favorite Prize winner in the Yellow Springs Chamber Music Competition for
Emerging Professional Ensembles and Silver Medal winner of the Chesapeake International
Chamber Music Competition, both in 2022. Abeo was also a finalist in the 2021 Young Concert
Artists International Competition and the silver medal winner of the 2019 Fischoff National
Chamber Music Competition.</p>

<p>One of the quartet’s earliest performances was at The Kennedy Center’s Reach Festival with
distinguished pianist Joseph Kalichstein in 2019. Highlights of Abeo’s 2022-2023 season
include performances at Music@Menlo, Schneider Concert Series, the Great Lakes Chamber Music
Festival and collaborations with members of the Calidore, Dover and Emerson string quartets.</p>

<p>Abeo has also appeared at Alice Tully Hall, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center’s

<p>During their time at Juilliard, Abeo studied regularly in the Honors Chamber Music Program
under the tutelage of The Juilliard String Quartet with Joseph Lin, Astrid Schween and Roger

Nigerian dialect — to reflect their love for playing chamber music and sharing it with
others.</p>
