<h2 id="about-the-lysander-piano-trio">About the Lysander Piano Trio</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ensembles/lysander_piano_trio.png" alt="Lysander Piano Trio" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lysandertrio.com">Lysander Piano Trio</a> has been praised by The Strad for its
“incredible ensemble, passionate playing, articulate and imaginative ideas and wide palette
of colors” and by The Washington Post for “an uncommon degree of heart-on-the-sleeve
emotional frankness” and “vivid engagement carried by soaring, ripely Romantic playing.” The
group has developed a reputation for exciting programming, finding creative ways to connect
well-known masterworks with pieces by lesser-known and underrepresented composers,
discovering common threads across cultures and times.</p>

<p>The Trio’s debut recording “After A Dream” (CAG Records) was acclaimed by The New York Times
for its “polished and spirited interpretations.” Its most recent album, “Mirrors”, featuring
world-premiere recordings of six works the ensemble has commissioned or premiered, was
released in early 2021 by First Hand Records.</p>

<p>Formed at The Juilliard School, the Trio studied there with Ronald Copes of the Juilliard
String Quartet, the late Joseph Kalichstein and Seymour Lipkin, and had a memorable
masterclass with Alfred Brendel. Early in their career, Lysander became a standout at
competitions, with top honors at the 2010 Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition, the
2011 Coleman Chamber Ensemble Competition (Grand Prize), the 2011 J. C. Arriaga Chamber
Music Competition (First Prize), and the 2012 Concert Artists Guild Victor Elmaleh
Competition.</p>

<p>The Trio’s name is inspired by the character in Shakespeare’s <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-artists">About the Artists</h2>

<h3 id="itamar-zorman">Itamar Zorman</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/itamar_zorman.png" alt="Itamar Zorman" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Recently awarded the 2014 Borletti-Buitoni Trust Award and the 2013 Avery Fisher Career
Grant, violinist <a href="https://www.itamarzorman.com">Itamar Zorman</a> was awarded a silver medal in
the 2011 International Tchaikovsky Competition. Other competition successes include the
first prize and special prize for a performance of a Mozart Concerto at the 2010
International Violin Competition of Freiburg and the Juilliard Berg Concerto Competition in
April 2011, which led to his Avery Fisher Hall debut with the Juilliard Orchestra led by the
late James DePreist.</p>

<p>Itamar Zorman has performed as a soloist with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, American
Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall, Het Gelders Orkest in Amsterdam’s Concertgebouw, Tokyo

Chamber Project, Zorman has toured Israel and North America for the past five seasons.</p>

<p>Born in Tel-Aviv in 1985 to a family of musicians, Itamar Zorman began his violin studies at
the age of six with Saly Bockel at the Israeli Conservatory of Music in Tel-Aviv.  He
graduated in 2003 and continued his studies with Professor David Chen and Nava Milo. He
received his Bachelor of Music from the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance as a student of

the program in 2016-2017 for concerts in Nepal and Japan.  He is a regular cello and chamber music
faculty at the Csehy Summer School of Music and the Chamber Music Institute in Stamford, CT, and was
an adjunct professor of cello at Nyack College from 2015-2017.</p>

<h3 id="liza-stepanova">Liza Stepanova</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/liza_stepanova.png" alt="Liza Stepanova" class="float-right" /></p>

committed to new music, she has premiered works by Jennifer Higdon and Libby Larsen and worked with
composers William Bolcom, Gabriela Lena Frank, and John Harbison.</p>

<p>Liza Stepanova studied art song collaboration with Wolfram Rieger in Berlin and was invited by the
late Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau to perform in several of his master classes including the
Hugo-Wolf-Tage festival in Austria. Since 2010, Stepanova has been on the faculty at SongFest at The
