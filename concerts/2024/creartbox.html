<h3 id="matthew-cohen">Matthew Cohen</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/matthew_cohen.png" alt="Matthew Cohen" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Ukrainian-American violist <a href="http://www.cohenviola.com">Matthew Cohen</a> is a dynamic and
versatile artist whose captivating performances have made him one of the most sought-after
violists of his generation. Recently appointed as the violist of the Formosa Quartet and a
founding member of Ensemble Elatós, he was a special prize winner at the prestigious
Primrose International Viola Competition as well as garnering top prizes at the Citta di
Cremona International Viola Competition in Italy, Vivo International Music Competition and
the Art of Duo International Competition. Particularly interested in advocating for the
viola as a unique voice, he is challenging the misconception that the viola has a limited
repertoire by bringing attention to lesser-known gems as well as arrangements of other
masterworks.</p>

<p>Recent solo engagements include his Lincoln Center debut performing Bartok’s Viola Concerto
with the Juilliard Orchestra in Alice Tully Hall, Hummel’s Potpourri with the Gstaad
Festival Orchestra, Bartok’s Viola Concerto with I Virtuosi Italiani in Cremona, Italy, and
presenting the world premiere of Garry Schyman’s viola concerto “Zingaro” with the Los
Angeles Jewish Symphony. Upcoming appearances include performances at Philadelphia Chamber
Music Society, Irvine Philharmonic Society, Music Mondays - Toronto, the University of
Houston, and recitals for the Performing Arts Consortium in Hilton Head, South Carolina and
Core Memory Music in Wakefield, Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Cohen is a graduate of the Juilliard School’s Master of Music program where he was the proud
recipient of a Kovner Fellowship. He has served as a member of the chamber music faculty at
the National Youth Orchestra of Canada and the Heifetz Institute and is the co-founder and
Artistic Director of Opus 71 Concerts, a multidisciplinary concert series near New York’s
Lincoln Center. His recording of York Bowen’s Phantasy for viola and piano with acclaimed
pianist Vivian Fan is available on the Soundset label.</p>

<p>In addition to his musical activities, he enjoys public speaking and has acted in a number
of plays including various works of Shakespeare, Peter Pan, Auntie Mame, and the musical
Bugsy Malone.</p>

<h3 id="guillermo-laporta">Guillermo Laporta</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/guillermo_laporta.png" alt="Guillermo Laporta" class="float-right" /></p>

<p><a href="https://guillermolaporta.com">Guillermo Laporta</a> is a flutist, composer, designer,
multimedia creator, and arts entrepreneur based in New York City. He is the founder and
executive director of the arts organization CreArtBox, a resident artist at CultureLabLIC,
Queens, and president of ADAMR-Art development in rural Spain.</p>

<p>Laporta’s artistic work focuses on the development and visual expansion of classical music.
Since 2006 he has created hundreds of productions highlighting the opera-ballet Two Roads
(2020), the visual concert Awave (2018), the play/concert Visuality (2014/16), the opera
Noctum (2011), the musical London The show (2009), and CreArt Project I (2006).</p>

<p>His work has been recommended by The New Yorker, Broadway World, El Pais, or Time Out and
awarded by the Queens Council on the Arts, the Amphion Foundation, Ditson Fund, New York
Foundation for the Arts, NY State Council on the Arts and Spain Culture.</p>

<p>Guillermo was co-principal flute player of the Oviedo Filarmonia in Spain. He has worked
with multiple world-class musicians and orchestras such as the BBC Orchestra, recording with
Warner Music and Naxos and performing at venues such as Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Tokyo
Monten Hall, and most of the major concert halls in Spain.</p>

<p>His discography expands the flute repertoire releasing transcriptions of violin sonatas by
Debussy, Respighi, or Janacek, commissioned pieces to living-composers, and recordings of
his own composition.</p>

<p>Guillermo studied at the Royal College of Music of London with flutist and conductor Jaime
Martín.</p>

<h3 id="josefina-urraca">Josefina Urraca</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/josefina_urraca.png" alt="Josefina Urraca" class="float-right" /></p>

crafted visual aesthetic. CreArtBox has been celebrated by The New Yorker as one of its “art
and music top picks”, and by Time Out as an “ensemble devoted to multidisciplinary events”.
Through thoughtfully designed programs, CreArtBox strives to cultivate an appreciation for
the arts in today’s society. Additionally, Josefina is the founder of a platform dedicated
to developing the arts in rural areas of Spain, and the ADAMR Festival.</p>

<p>Throughout her career, Josefina has garnered numerous prizes and accolades across Europe and
