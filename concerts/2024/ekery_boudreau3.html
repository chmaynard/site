<h2 id="about-the-artists">About the Artists</h2>

<h3 id="amanda-ekery">Amanda Ekery</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/amanda_ekery.png" alt="Amanda Ekery" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Vocalist and composer <a href="https://www.amandaekery.com">Amanda Ekery</a> conjures a rich creative world in
which improvised and popular music traditions weave together seamlessly. Her exceptional musical
versatility has made Ekery a sought-after performer, presenter, and composer for a wide range of
artistic endeavors.</p>

<p>Her compositions have earned support from New Music USA, Chamber Music America, and the Jerome
Foundation, and have been featured at the Portland Jazz Festival, Panama Jazz Festival, and the
Kennedy Center. Ekery’s 2018 album “Keys With No Purpose” was written as a reaction to the sexist
culture women continue to face in jazz and informed by her research on females in jazz education.</p>

<p>Árabe, Amanda’s most recent project, focuses on Syrian immigration to El Paso/Mexico and the
influence these mixed cultures had on film, food, economy, and music. She collaborates with the
Syrian Ladies Club of El Paso, recent immigrants, Middle Eastern scholars, and her family to write
lyrics, gather artifacts, and create interactive exhibits for the El Paso community.</p>

<p>Amanda holds a Master of Music in Jazz Performance from the New England Conservatory and a Bachelor
of Music in Jazz Studies from the University of North Texas. She is the Assistant Director of
Academic Affairs for the New School of Jazz and Contemporary Music, a teaching artist for the
Metropolitan Opera Guild, the education coordinator at Jazz at Lincoln Center, and a regular at the
Cortelyou Library in Brooklyn, NY.</p>

<h3 id="andrew-boudreau">Andrew Boudreau</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/andrew_boudreau.png" alt="Andrew Boudreau" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Pianist <a href="https://www.andrewboudreaumusic.com">Andrew Boudreau</a> is an active member of the
North American and international jazz and creative music scenes. He has performed with a
diverse array of musicians and ensembles including the Orchestre national de jazz de
Montréal with David Binney, soprano Measha Brueggergosman, and the Altsys Jazz Orchestra. As
a soloist, he has been pianist-in-residence at 7132 (Vals, Switzerland) and at the Peabody
Essex Museum (Salem, MA).</p>

<p>In 2019, Andrew was a prizewinner at the Jacksonville Jazz Piano Competition (formerly known
as the Great American Jazz Piano Competition). One of eight Canadian musicians to receive
the Astral Artist Prize (2013) at the National Arts Centre (Ottawa, Canada), Andrew is also
the recipient of the OPUS Prize for Concert of the Year - Jazz and World Music in Quebec
(2016).</p>

<p>Andrew’s formal training includes a Master of Music at the New England Conservatory,
Bachelor of Music at the Schulich School of Music (McGill University), and Associate of the
Royal Conservatory Diploma (Piano Performance) from the Royal Conservatory of Music
(Toronto).</p>

<p>A native of Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada, Andrew currently lives in Brooklyn.</p>
