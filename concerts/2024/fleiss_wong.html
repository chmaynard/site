<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/sarah_fleiss.png" alt="Sarah Fleiss" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>American soprano <a href="https://www.sarahfleiss.com/about">Sarah Fleiss</a> is in her fourth year of
studies at the Curtis Institute of Music. This season, she will sing Ginevra in Handel’s
Ariodante under the baton of David Stern and with the Tempesta di Mare orchestra. She is
currently on tour with Eric Owens and members of the Curtis Opera Theater, singing the
Brahms Neue Liebeslieder Op. 65, among other art song and operatic repertoire. In 2023, she
will premiere In the Fields, a song cycle written by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Tania
León and is set to perform in a recital along with one of the world’s most sought-after
collaborative pianists, Warren Jones.</p>

<p>Sarah was recently named the 1st Prize winner of the Shirley Rabb Winston Scholarship by the
National Society of Arts and Letters. She has received scholarships from the George London
Foundation and Voce di Meche, an encouragement award from the Gerda Lissner Foundation, as
well as been named a finalist in the Camile Coloratura, Opera Grand Rapids, and Orpheus
Vocal Competitions.</p>

<p>Prior to Curtis, Sarah attended Columbia University, and the Juilliard- Exchange program. At
Columbia, she sang Pamina in Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte with the Columbia New Opera Workshop,
and narrated Stravinsky’s L’Histoire du soldat. She also performed around New York in
musical theater and cabaret-style performances.</p>

<p>Collaborative pianist Ting Ting Wong is a vocal coach and accompanist in the Philadelphia
area. She made her debut as a collaborative pianist at the Kennedy Center in 2016 and
performed with IlluminArts in Miami in April 2019.</p>

<p>Ms. Wong is currently a staff accompanist for the Academy of Vocal Arts; accompanist for the
Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia, the Jefferson University Singers (East Falls Campus), and
the Philadelphia Voices of Pride; and director of music at Newtown Square Presbyterian
Church and the Union League Voices. She joined the adjunct faculty at the Curtis Institute
of Music in 2019.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Hong Kong, Ms. Wong holds a master’s degree in piano performance from

<h2 id="about-curtis">About Curtis</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ensembles/curtis_logo.png" alt="Curtis Institute" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.curtis.edu">Curtis Institute of Music</a> in Philadelphia educates and trains
exceptionally gifted young musicians to engage a local and global community through the
highest level of artistry. One of the most selective schools in the United States, Curtis
accepts four percent of applicants each year on average, and a tuition-free policy ensures
that talent and artistic promise are the only considerations for admission.</p>

<p>With a small student body of about 175, Curtis ensures that each young musician receives an
education of unparalleled quality, distinguished by a “learn by doing” philosophy and
personalized attention from a faculty that includes a high proportion of actively performing
musicians.</p>

<p>Curtis students hone their craft through than 200 orchestra, opera, and solo and chamber
music offerings each year and programs that bring arts access and education to the
community. This real-world training allows these extraordinary young musicians to join the
front rank of performers, composers, conductors, and musical leaders, making a profound
impact on music onstage and in their communities.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.curtis.edu/curtis-performances/on-tour/">Curtis on Tour</a> is the Nina von
Maltzahn global touring initiative of the Curtis Institute of Music. An embodiment of the
school’s “learn by doing” philosophy, it offers students real-world, professional touring
experience alongside celebrated alumni and faculty. In addition to performances, musicians
offer master classes, interactive programs, and community engagement activities while on
tour.</p>

<p>In addition to national and international tours, Curtis on Tour manages professional
performance engagements for Curtis students and recent graduates, providing emerging artists
with the matchless experience of appearing with leading ensembles and presenting
organizations.</p>
