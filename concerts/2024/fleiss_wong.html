<p>Prior to Curtis, Sarah attended Columbia University, and the Juilliard- Exchange program. At
Columbia, she sang Pamina in Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte with the Columbia New Opera Workshop,
and narrated Stravinsky’s L’Histoire du soldat. She also performed around New York in
musical theater and cabaret-style performances.</p>
