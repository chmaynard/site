<p>Praised for his interpretive sensitivity, imaginative programming, and ability to make classical
music speak to all kinds of audiences, Canadian pianist Carter Johnson is quickly establishing a
reputation as one of his generation’s most gifted and multi-faceted pianists. His most recent
competition prizes include being the first prize laureate in the 2021 International Competition of
Polish Music, the first prize winner of the 2020 Valsesia International Competition and first prize
winner of the 2023 Weatherford College International Competition, and he was also recently awarded
the Most Promising Pianist not Proceeding to the Final in the 2023 Sydney International Piano
Competition. In 2018, Johnson won the top prize in two of Canada’s most important competitions,
garnering both the grand prize in the Concours OSM and the first prize in the CMC Stepping Stone
competition. Other competition experience includes the Santander International Competition, the
Shenzhen International Concerto Competition, the Horowitz International Competition Kyiv-Geneva, the
Dublin International Competition, and the Hilton Head International Competition.</p>

<p>Johnson has performed with orchestras including l’Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, l’Orchestre
Métropolitain, the Poznań Philharmonic Orchestra, the Victoria Symphony Orchestra, the Silesian
Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Orchestra of the Americas, and his playing has been broadcasted by
CBC Radio and medici.tv. Venues in which he has performed concertos or solo recitals include the
Maison Symphonique, the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts, the Music Shed at Norfolk, the Shenzhen
Concert Hall, and the Warsaw National Philharmonic Hall.</p>

<p>Born in 1996 on Vancouver Island, Canada, Johnson began the study of piano at age 5 with Shelley
Roberts, with whom he had the privilege of studying both performance and pedagogy for over 12 years.
After continuing his studies with Michelle Mares, he completed a Bachelor of Music with Mark
Anderson at the University of British Columbia. He then received a Master of Music from the
Juilliard School under the direction of Joseph Kalichstein and Matti Raekallio, and continued to the
Yale School of Music, where he completed a Master of Musical Arts with Wei-Yi Yang and is continuing
there for his Doctor of Musical Arts degree.</p>

<p>Equally at home in the worlds of solo, concerto, chamber, and art song, Johnson has a particular
interest in bringing light to lesser-explored parts of the repertory, most recently championing a
collection of works by nearly-forgotten Polish composers. In addition to the music of J.S. Bach
(where he feels most at home), he is a special advocate for the music of composers such as Schumann,
Grieg, Fauré, Ives, Hindemith, Poulenc, Shostakovich, and Messiaen. His secondary instrument work
has included studies in oboe, voice, and harpsichord.</p>

<p>Trained in elocution as a teenager, Johnson holds an ATCL with distinction in speech and drama from
Trinity College London, and he regularly brings this expertise to his recitals in his discussions on
the music that is being played — for many audiences, these continue to be a highlight of his
performances. This skill was recognized in the 2023 Sydney International Piano Competition, where he
was awarded the Best Program Presentation in the Semifinal for his program design and verbal
introductions.</p>

<p>Johnson currently resides in Hamden, Connecticut with his wife Hannah and their young boys Preston
and Ambrose, where he maintains a busy schedule as a concert artist, student, and teacher. In his
spare time, he and Hannah enjoy both cooking together and watching good films, and spending time
outside with their boys enjoying the charms of New England.</p>
