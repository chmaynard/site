<h2 id="about-the-artists">About the Artists</h2>

<h3 id="martine-thomas">Martine Thomas</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/martine_thomas.png" alt="Martine Thomas" class="float-right" /></p>

Berliner Philharmonie, Carnegie Hall, Kennedy Center, Mariinsky Theatre, Disney Hall, the
KKL Lucerne, the Beijing National Centre for the Performing Arts, and at the BBC Proms,
Mariinsky White Nights Festival, Donaueschingen Festival, and Lucerne Festival. She has
performed as a soloist and chamber musician with Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble, the
International Contemporary Ensemble, JACK Quartet, Tyshawn Sorey, Kim Kashkashian, and Ghost
Ensemble.</p>

<p>Martine loves presenting solo recitals, and is looking forward to recitals this year in New
York City, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and upstate New York. She is also passionate about
recitals and concerts in community-oriented settings, including as a Music for Food artist
fellow, through Meristem Artists, at the Biophony Festival, and in Celebrity Series Concert
for One. Martine has a special interest in contemporary music and working with composers,
which has led to recent collaborations and premieres with Tyshawn Sorey, Rebecca Saunders,
George Lewis, Catherine Lamb, Miya Masaoka, and Joy Guidry as well as extensive workshops
and performances at the Banff Centre and Lucerne Festival.</p>

West and is the staff accompanist for the Puerto Piano &amp; Strings International Music
Festival. She regularly appears recitals at Sacred Music at Columbia University and Music at
