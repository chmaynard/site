<h2 id="about-the-paddington-trio">About the Paddington Trio</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ensembles/paddington_trio.png" alt="Paddington Trio" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>“Their youth does not remotely detract from their excellence - these are accomplished
musicians by any standard, not only in technique but in rapport and nuance. In places, there
was true beauty but never as an end in itself: everything served a higher conception of the
music. I have rarely been so excited by performers new to me.” -Strings Attached</p>

<p>Seen as the one of the most exciting chamber ensembles of their generation, the Paddington
Trio has been recognized in international competitions and live performances for their fresh
interpretations and exuberant energy. As did the famous bear, Finnish violinist Tuulia Hero,
Irish cellist Patrick Moriarty and American pianist Stephanie Tang have made London their
home and emerged as an ensemble of an entirely unique and lasting entity. The trio is
celebrated for its close and energetic communication, insightful and imaginative programming
as well as its highly refined ensemble playing. The trio’s grand mission is to bridge the
gap between new listeners and serious classical music enthusiasts by welcoming everyone into
their living room of musical discovery and shared love of chamber music.</p>

<p>Having started their first adventure together at the Paddington Station in 2020, a year
after they met, the trio won the First Prize in the 70th Royal Over-Seas League Competition
for Strings &amp; Piano Ensemble. Since then, they have won First Prize in the 2024 Triomphe de
l’Art International Competition, 2023 Schiermonnikoog Festival Audience Award and the 2022
NEW FORMATS Project Prize. They are currently generously supported by the City Music
Foundation, Kirckman Concert Society and GBZ Management. In the summer of 2023, the trio
completed an Artist Fellowship programme at their alma mater, the Guildhall School of Music
&amp; Drama in London, and in 2023/24 continues to teach and inspire young ensembles as Chamber
Fellows in the renowned Chamber Fellowship Programme at the Royal Northern College of Music.</p>

<p>In March 2023, the Paddington Trio made its concerto debut performing the Beethoven Triple
Concerto with Jan Söderblom and the Jyväskylä Symphony Orchestra in Finland. They have
appeared in prominent halls and series, such as Wigmore Hall, LSO St. Luke’s, Oxford Coffee
Concerts, St. George’s Bristol and the BBC Total Immersion. Their most recent debuts saw
them at the TivoliVredenburg and the Schiermonnikoog Festival in the Netherlands, the
Edinburgh Fringe, Buxton International and Brighton Festivals, and Lake District Summer
Music. The trio has appeared on YLE Radio (Finland) and BBC Radio 3 In Tune.</p>

<p>Tuulia, Patrick and Stephanie have had the privilege to work closely with internationally
renowned musicians, such as Eberhard Feltz, Marc Danel, Gary Hoffman, Levon Chilingirian,
Robert Levin, Johannes Meissl, David Dolan and members of the Ébène, Takács, Endellion and
Meta4 quartets. They join the European Chamber Music Academy in 2023 and also receive
mentorships from ChamberStudio and the Netherlands String Quartet Academy. The trio studied
under Thomas Adès at the IMS Prussia Cove’s 50th anniversary masterclasses.</p>
