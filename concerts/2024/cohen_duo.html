<p>Ukrainian-American violist <a href="http://www.cohenviola.com">Matthew Cohen</a> is a dynamic and
versatile artist whose captivating performances have made him one of the most sought-after
violists of his generation. Recently appointed as the violist of the Formosa Quartet and a
founding member of Ensemble Elatós, he was a special prize winner at the prestigious
Primrose International Viola Competition as well as garnering top prizes at the Citta di
Cremona International Viola Competition in Italy, Vivo International Music Competition and
the Art of Duo International Competition. Particularly interested in advocating for the
viola as a unique voice, he is challenging the misconception that the viola has a limited
repertoire by bringing attention to lesser-known gems as well as arrangements of other
masterworks.</p>

<p>Recent solo engagements include his Lincoln Center debut performing Bartok’s Viola Concerto
with the Juilliard Orchestra in Alice Tully Hall, Hummel’s Potpourri with the Gstaad
Festival Orchestra, Bartok’s Viola Concerto with I Virtuosi Italiani in Cremona, Italy, and
presenting the world premiere of Garry Schyman’s viola concerto “Zingaro” with the Los
Angeles Jewish Symphony. Upcoming appearances include performances at Philadelphia Chamber
Music Society, Irvine Philharmonic Society, Music Mondays - Toronto, the University of
Houston, and recitals for the Performing Arts Consortium in Hilton Head, South Carolina and
Core Memory Music in Wakefield, Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Cohen is a graduate of the Juilliard School’s Master of Music program where he was the proud
recipient of a Kovner Fellowship. He has served as a member of the chamber music faculty at
the National Youth Orchestra of Canada and the Heifetz Institute and is the co-founder and
Artistic Director of Opus 71 Concerts, a multidisciplinary concert series near New York’s
Lincoln Center. His recording of York Bowen’s Phantasy for viola and piano with acclaimed
pianist Vivian Fan is available on the Soundset label.</p>

<p>In addition to his musical activities, he enjoys public speaking and has acted in a number
of plays including various works of Shakespeare, Peter Pan, Auntie Mame, and the musical
Bugsy Malone.</p>

Artists Worldwide Debut Audition, Astral Artist’s National Auditions and the Grieg
International Competition in Norway. Ms. Li-Cohen is currently the Associate Professor of

Lemelin.</p>

<p>Ms. Li-Cohen is the co-founder and Artistic Director of Opus 71 Concerts, a multimedia
