<p>Prize-winning violinist <a href="https://www.mayaanjali.com">Maya Anjali Buchanan</a>, from Rapid City,
South Dakota, began playing violin at age three. In this student spotlight, she shares her
musical path from using a Froot Loops cereal box as an instrument to performing on the
world’s most exciting stages with her violin, and discusses how her peers constantly inspire
her. Ms. Buchanan first entered the Curtis Institute of Music in 2018 and received a
Bachelor of Music degree in 2023. She is currently pursuing her master’s, studying violin
with Ida Kavafian as the Jill and Sheldon Bonovitz Fellow.</p>

<p>As a young child Ms. Buchanan began Suzuki Method violin lessons at the insistence of her
mother, whom she credits for igniting her journey as a musician. She recalls a pivotal
moment in her childhood when she was driven home from a concert, and her father asked what
her favorite part of performing was. They both were pleasantly surprised with her
response—the thing she looked forward to the most was the thrill of walking onto a stage.</p>

<p>Named a Yamaha Young Performing Artist in 2020, Ms. Buchanan won first prize at the
Crain-Maling Foundation Chicago Symphony Orchestra Young Artist Competition in 2017 and
subsequently made her debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In an effort to broaden
Western classical music traditions, Ms. Buchanan unveils the music of her heritage by
presenting pieces unique to her Indian ancestry, bridging her Eastern roots with her Western
classical training. She enjoys showcasing works of Indian influence that reflect the form
and improvisational quality of Eastern music, blending techniques of both cultures.</p>

<p>When Ms. Buchanan is not playing on her c. 1730 Guarneri “del Gesù” violin from Cremona,
generously on loan from the Stradivari Society of Chicago, she takes macro photos of insects
and loves doing outreach in the community.</p>
