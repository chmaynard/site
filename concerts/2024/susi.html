<p>Described in The WholeNote as “an innovative musician and aggressive thinker with a gift for
keyboard brilliance,” <a href="https://www.nicholas-susi.com/">Nicholas Susi</a> enjoys a
multifaceted career living out his deep love of music. He recognizes that classical music
has been a transformative force in his life and seeks to share its power with others
through his teaching and performing.</p>

<p>As a teenager, Nicholas experienced a musical turning point upon discovering the music of
Franz Liszt. Thrilled by the composer’s virtuoso music and inspirational biography, he
became a lifelong super-fan of all things Liszt. Performances and projects centering around
the Hungarian composer have been a recurring theme throughout Dr. Susi’s career. In 2014,
Susi advanced to the semifinals of the International Franz Liszt Piano Competition (Utrecht,
The Netherlands) as one of two Americans selected worldwide to participate in this
prestigious competition.</p>

<p>Dr. Susi’s career took off upon winning the 2015 National Federation of Music
Clubs (NFMC) Young Artist Competition. Winners of this competition receive two years of
management, which resulted in performances, masterclasses, and lectures across the country.
At the same time, Susi recorded and released his debut album, Scarlatti Now, to critical
acclaim; in addition to international radio airplay, the disc was featured on the
prestigious Critics’ Choice list (2017) of American Record Guide and was chosen as a 1st
place winner of The American Prize in 2018.</p>

<p>Dr. Susi is Assistant Professor of Piano at the University of South Carolina. He previously
taught piano and music theory at The College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, MN. He completed
his doctorate at the University of Michigan, with previous studies at the University of
Kansas and at the Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln as a two-time DAAD grantee. Primary
teachers include Zena Ilyashov, Jack Winerock, Nina Tichman, and Arthur Greene.</p>
