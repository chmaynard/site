<h2 id="about-the-callisto-quartet">About the Callisto Quartet</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ensembles/callisto_quartet2.png" alt="Callisto Quartet" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.callistoquartet.com/">Callisto Quartet</a> has been praised for their “lush
intensity and bravado” and the “cohesion and intonation one might expect from an ensemble
twice their age” (Third Coast Review). The American/Canadian Callisto Quartet brings
together four musicians who share a deep passion for bringing chamber music to audiences
around the world.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 2016, Callisto has garnered top prizes in nearly every major
international chamber music competition and has been hailed by audiences across the globe.
Grand Prize winners of the 2018 Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition and Second Prize
Winners of the 2019 Banff International String Quartet Competition, the Callisto Quartet has
also taken home prizes from the Bordeaux, Melbourne, and Wigmore Hall competitions. They

Concert Series, Ravinia Festival, and the Heidelberg String Quartet Festival.</p>

very first quartet at the age of 7 in her hometown of Worthington, Ohio. As a founding
member of the Callisto Quartet, she has had the opportunity to perform some of classical
music’s greatest repertoire across North America and around the world. The Callisto Quartet

help them become their own best teachers. She has taught and given masterclasses for
violinists, violists, and chamber ensembles at numerous music schools, festivals, and
