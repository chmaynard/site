<p>The program will be announced soon.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-merz-trio">About the Merz Trio</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ensembles/merz_trio.png" alt="Merz Trio" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Winners of the Naumburg, Concert Artists Guild, Fischoff, and Chesapeake Competitions, 
<a href="https://www.merztrio.com/home/">Merz Trio</a> 
are passionately committed to reshaping the narrative of classical music through vibrantly
dynamic programming and wide-ranging interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>

<p>Their narrative programming style juxtaposes classical standards, new music, and their own
arrangements of familiar and forgotten works, fluidly interwoven and guided with speaking from
the Trio’s members. Their interdisciplinary collaborations include ongoing projects with dancer
Caroline Copeland, Sandglass Puppet Theater, chef David Bouley, and videographer Chris Kitchen.</p>

<p>In coming seasons, Merz Trio are looking forward to debuts at Merkin Hall in NYC, the Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. They have been encouraged
in their explorations by numerous institutional homes around the world, including the New
England Conservatory, Yellow Barn, Snape Maltings, Avaloch Farm Institute, the Naumburg
Foundation, the Lake Champlain, Olympic, and Chesapeake Music Festivals, and the Fischoff
Competition.</p>

<p>Merz Trio are represented by Concert Artists Guild and make their homes in Boston.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-artists">About the Artists</h2>

<h3 id="amy-yang">Amy Yang</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/amy_yang.png" alt="Amy Yang" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Praised by the Washington Post as a “jaw-dropping pianist who steals the show…with effortless
finesse,” pianist Amy Yang joined forces with the Curtis Symphony Orchestra under Osmo Vänskä
playing Schumann’s Piano Concerto at Verizon Hall at the Kimmel Center in 2023. Additionally, she
gave the world premiere of Richard Danielpour’s “Four Portraits” for solo piano at the Curtis
Institute of Music, where she is a faculty member and the Associate Dean of Piano Studies and
Artistic Initiatives.</p>

<p>Her commitment to artistry and leadership is expressed on and off stage, as she appears as soloist,
chamber musician, and pedagogue passionate about empowering young artists who will uphold our art
form. She has appeared as a soloist with the Houston Symphony, and presented recitals for
Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, Texas Music Festival, Kosciuszko Foundation and Coastal
Concerts. She has premiered and recorded music by Caroline Shaw, Avner Dorman, Michael Hersch, Ezra
Laderman, and commissioned works from Alistair Coleman, Edward Babcock, and Hua Yang.  Among the
countless joyful moments of sharing the stage are treasured recitals with Roberto Díaz, Yefim
Bronfman, Miriam Fried, Richard Goode, Ani and Ida Kavafian, Bomsori Kim, Patricia Kopatchinskaya,
Tessa Lark, Anne-Marie McDermott, Tito Muñoz, Paul Neubauer, Tara Helen O’Conor, David Shifrin,
Joseph Silverstein, Arnold Steinhardt, Philippe Tondre, Michael Tree, Peter Wiley, Danbi Um; the St.
Paul and Mahler chamber orchestras; Third Coast Percussion; A Far Cry; and the Dover, Jasper, and
Aizuri string quartets.</p>

<p>She has performed in venues such as Wigmore Hall and Carnegie Recital Hall; at the Marlboro,
Ravinia, Aldeburgh, Bravo! Vail, Chelsea, Olympic, and Ojai music festivals; Verbier Academy; Cal
Performances; Caramoor; IMS Prussia Cove; Music from Angel Fire; and Chamber Music Northwest, among
others. An episode on her by Emmy® Award-winning producer Jim Cotter’s Articulate show aired on PBS
in 2021.</p>

<p>Ms. Yang is an alumna of the Curtis Institute of Music, the Juilliard School, and the Yale School of
Music, where she received the Parisot Award for Outstanding Pianist and the Alumni Association
Prize. Her past teachers include Li Qing, Timothy Hester, Claude Frank, Robert McDonald, and Peter
Frankl. Ardent to champion young voices on this pedagogical legacy, her own students have soloed
with the Philadelphia Orchestra and entered Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Bard Conservatory,
Vanderbilt University Blair School of Music, Eastman School of Music, Peabody Institute, and Indiana
University. She has given masterclasses at UCLA, Mannes College of Music, University of Oklahoma,
The Suzuki School, and for New York Youth Symphony. She won the 2018 Musical Fund Society prize and
the Kosciuszko National Chopin Piano Competition.</p>

<p>When not serving the various keyboards related to her roles, her intentionally incognito presence
may be revealed by a quivering Micron pen as she sketches from the back of concert halls. The work
of a lifetime is where she hopes to question, explore, and linger every day.</p>

<h3 id="brigid-coleridge">Brigid Coleridge</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/brigid_coleridge.png" alt="Brigid Coleridge" class="float-right" /></p>

been in professional residence at the New England Conservatory of Music. With the Trio, Brigid is a
regular invitee to the Olympic, Lake Champlain and Chesapeake Festivals and has undertaken
residencies at Yellow Barn, Snape Maltings and Avaloch Farm Institute. The trio received the 2021
Naumburg Competition First Prize, and their first album “Ink” debuted in 2021 at #2 in the Classical

Hall.</p>

<p>As a recitalist, Brigid has performed in Australia and internationally in venues such as the Royal
Albert Hall, Wigmore Hall, Jordan Hall, the Kennedy Center and the Purcell Room. Highlights include
a tour of Holland and an artist residency undertaken for Yellow Barn Festival in the US. Brigid’s
recital projects often focus on her interest in music, literature and theatre, displaying a
multidisciplinary engagement with the works she presents. She is particularly interested in
exploring the theatrical possibilities of performance.</p>

<p>Brigid holds a doctoral degree in music from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York,
where she worked on Beethoven’s late Mass, the Missa Solemnis. In addition, Brigid holds an Artist
Diploma and a Masters Degree in Performance from the Royal College of Music, London. She graduated
BA/BMus from the University of Melbourne following studies in English Literature, French Language
and Violin Performance. Important music mentors include Donald Weilerstein, Daniel Phillips, Maciej
Rakowski and Mark Mogilevski.</p>
