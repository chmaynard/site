<h2 id="about-the-artist">About the Artist</h2>

<h3 id="christopher-goodpasture">Christopher Goodpasture</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/christopher_goodpasture.png" alt="Christopher Goodpasture" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Praised by the Washington Post for his sparkling, highly musical playing, pianist
<a href="https://www.christophergoodpasture.com">Christopher Goodpasture</a> has established himself as
a musician of refined style. The Toronto Concert Review described his playing as a “rare
combination of strength, energy and sublime musical sensitivity…matched by a heavenly sense
of melodic line”. His imaginative approach to programming reflects a penchant for unusual
repertoire and narrative that is both unconventional and provocative. He has performed
recitals in concert venues throughout North America, including the Kennedy Center
(Washington D.C.), Benaroya Hall (Seattle), Koerner Hall (Toronto), Alice Tully Hall, Merkin
Hall, Weill Recital Hall (New York), Bing Concert Hall (San Francisco), and the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art.</p>

<p>Recent and upcoming orchestral appearances include concertos with the Sioux City Symphony,
The Oakville Symphony, Northumberland Orchestra, Acadiana Symphony Orchestra, and the
Chamber Orchestra of New York. Among his forthcoming projects is an album to be released on
Yarlung Records entitled Pollination, an exploration of sound world and atmosphere seen
through the eyes of composers including Bartók, Janáček, Debussy, Haydn, Takemitsu and
Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe.</p>

<p>From a young age, Christopher developed a keen interest in collaboration and now is a
sought-after chamber musician, having played for and collaborated with a number of noted
musicians. He has appeared as a fellow in Ravinia’s Steans Music Institute, in the intensive
chamber music program of David Finckel and Wu Han in Aspen, at the Music Academy of the
West, and in the festivals of Kneisel Hall, Sarasota and Banff. Among his collaborators are
members of the Takacs, Ysaye, St. Lawrence, Amenda, Guarneri, and Tokyo String Quartets.
Christopher’s work with pianists Seymour Lipkin, Joseph Kalichstein, Robert Levin, Claude
Frank, Leon Fleisher and violinists Pamela Frank and Sylvia Rosenberg has left a meaningful
impact on his work as a chamber musician.</p>

<p>Born in Los Angeles, California, Christopher’s formal training began at the Pasadena
Conservatory, where he enrolled in theory, chamber music, and for four years, composition
with award-winning American composer, Andrew Norman. He continued his studies with Stewart
Gordon and John Perry at the University of Southern California and the Royal Conservatory of
Music in Toronto. Christopher holds graduate degrees from Yale University and The Juilliard
School, where his teachers included Hung-Kuan Chen, Peter Frankl, Jerome Lowenthal and
Christopher Elton.</p>
