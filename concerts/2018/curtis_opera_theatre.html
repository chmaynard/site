<p>On Friday, October 19, 2018 at 7:30 pm, three artists from the Curtis
Institute of Music in Philadelphia performed selections from the song cycle <em>Italienisches
Liederbuch</em> (“Italian Songbook”) by the 19th-century Austrian composer Hugo Wolf.</p>

<p>This song cycle is a work of great drama, as a young couple rejects, and finally accepts,
the many aspects of falling in love. The artists will perform the songs in dramatic
dialogue, a kind of mini-opera. There is irresistible charm in this work but no happy
ending, as the woman  reveals that she has dozens of lovers in many cities.</p>

<p>The pianist was Mikael Eliasen, Chair of Vocal Studies at Curtis and Artistic Director of the
<a href="https://www.curtis.edu/performances/18-19-curtis-theatre-opera/">Curtis Opera Theatre</a>.
Mikael was joined by two distinguished vocal students at Curtis, Ashley Marie Robillard and
Dennis Chmelensky.</p>
