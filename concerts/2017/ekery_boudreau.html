<h3 id="amanda-ekery">Amanda Ekery</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/amanda_ekery.png" alt="Amanda Ekery" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Vocalist and composer <a href="https://www.amandaekery.com">Amanda Ekery</a> conjures a rich creative world in
which improvised and popular music traditions weave together seamlessly. Her exceptional musical
versatility has made Ekery a sought-after performer, presenter, and composer for a wide range of
artistic endeavors.</p>

<p>Her compositions have earned support from New Music USA, Chamber Music America, and the Jerome
Foundation, and have been featured at the Portland Jazz Festival, Panama Jazz Festival, and the
Kennedy Center. Ekery’s 2018 album “Keys With No Purpose” was written as a reaction to the sexist
culture women continue to face in jazz and informed by her research on females in jazz education.</p>

<p>Árabe, Amanda’s most recent project, focuses on Syrian immigration to El Paso/Mexico and the
influence these mixed cultures had on film, food, economy, and music. She collaborates with the
Syrian Ladies Club of El Paso, recent immigrants, Middle Eastern scholars, and her family to write
lyrics, gather artifacts, and create interactive exhibits for the El Paso community.</p>

<p>Amanda holds a Master of Music in Jazz Performance from the New England Conservatory and a Bachelor
of Music in Jazz Studies from the University of North Texas. She is the Assistant Director of
Academic Affairs for the New School of Jazz and Contemporary Music, a teaching artist for the
Metropolitan Opera Guild, the education coordinator at Jazz at Lincoln Center, and a regular at the
Cortelyou Library in Brooklyn, NY.</p>

a soloist, he has been pianist-in-residence at 7132 (Vals, Switzerland) and at the Peabody
Essex Museum (Salem, MA).</p>

<p>In 2019, Andrew was a prizewinner at the Jacksonville Jazz Piano Competition (formerly known

(2016).</p>
