<h3 id="geneva-lewis">Geneva Lewis</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/geneva_lewis.png" alt="Geneva Lewis" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>New Zealand-born violinist <a href="https://www.genevalewisviolinist.com">Geneva Lewis</a> has forged a
reputation as a musician of consummate artistry whose performances speak from and to the
heart. Lauded for “remarkable mastery of her instrument” (CVNC) and hailed as “clearly one
to watch” (Musical America), Geneva is the recipient of a 2022 Borletti-Buitoni Trust Award,
2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant and Grand Prize winner of the 2020 Concert Artists Guild
Competition. Additional accolades include Kronberg Academy’s Prince of Hesse Prize, being
named a Performance Today Young Artist in Residence, and Musical America’s New Artist of the
Month. Most recently, Geneva was named one of BBC Radio 3’s New Generation Artists.</p>

<p>Since her solo debut at age 11 with the Pasadena POPS, Geneva has gone on to perform with
orchestras including the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, Pasadena Symphony, Sarasota Orchestra,
Pensacola Symphony and Duluth Superior Symphony Orchestra and with conductors including
Nicholas McGegan, Edwin Outwater, Michael Feinstein, Sameer Patel, Peter Rubardt, and Dirk
Meyer. The 2022-23 season includes performances with the Auckland Philharmonia, North
Carolina Symphony, Augusta Symphony, Kansas City Symphony, Austin Symphony and Arkansas
Symphony. In recital, recent and upcoming highlights include performances at Wigmore Hall,
Tippet Rise, Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, Washington Performing Arts, Merkin Hall,
and the Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concerts.</p>

<p>Geneva received her Artist Diploma and Bachelor of Music as the recipient of the Charlotte
F. Rabb Presidential Scholarship at the New England Conservatory, studying with Miriam
Fried. Prior to that, she studied with Aimée Kreston at the Colburn School of Performing
Arts. She is currently studying at Kronberg Academy with Professor Mihaela Martin. These
studies are funded by the Strauss Family Patronage. Past summers have taken her to the
Marlboro Music Festival, Ravinia Steans Institute, Perlman Music Program’s Chamber Workshop,
International Holland Music Sessions, Taos School of Music and the Heifetz International
Music Institute.</p>

<p>Geneva is currently performing on a composite violin by G.B. Guadagnini, c. 1766, generously
on loan from a Charitable Trust.</p>

<h3 id="gabriel-martins">Gabriel Martins</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/gabriel_martins.png" alt="Gabriel Martins" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Cellist <a href="https://www.gabrielmartinscello.com">Gabriel Martins</a> (b. 1998) has established himself
as one of the world’s most enthralling young artists, with a deep commitment to the timeless
masterpieces of classical music. His artistry has already been recognized through an extensive
list of accolades including the 2020 Concert Artists Guild - Young Classical Artists Trust Grand
Prize, the 2020 Sphinx Competition Gold Medal, the David Popper International Cello Competition
Gold Medal, the International Tchaikovsky Competition for Young Musicians Silver Medal, the
Schadt String Competition Gold Medal, the Orford Music Award, and the Prague Spring Czech Music
Fund Prize. These successes have lead to a number of high-profile debuts including Wigmore,
Carnegie, and Merkin Halls, the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, Maison Symphonique in
Montréal, and the Arkansas, Memphis, Indianapolis, New Russian State, Pacific, and Phoenix
Symphony Orchestras. According to legendary cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, he has “revealed heart,
passion, intellect, and a finely-nuanced palette of colors in a compelling manner worthy of a
seasoned artist.”</p>

<p>Born of American and Brazilian heritage, Martins grew up in Bloomington, Indiana. He began
playing the cello when he was five, studying with Susan Moses at the Indiana University String
Academy. He went on to receive his B.M. as a Presidential Scholar at the USC Thornton School of
Music with Ralph Kirshbaum. In his freshman year at USC, he won the school’s concerto
competition as well as its Bach competition. He received his M.M. at the New England
Conservatory of Music. His festival appearances have included Ravinia’s Steans Music Institute,
where he was also selected to tour with Miriam Fried, and the Aspen Music Festival, where he won
the Concerto Competition. He plays on a composite Francesco Ruggieri cello made in Cremona, c.
1690 and a François Nicolas Voirin bow made in Paris, c. 1880.</p>
