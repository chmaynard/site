<h2 id="about-the-merz-trio">About the Merz Trio</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ensembles/merz_trio.png" alt="Merz Trio" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Winners of the Naumburg, Concert Artists Guild, Fischoff, and Chesapeake Competitions, 
<a href="https://www.merztrio.com/home/">Merz Trio</a> 
are passionately committed to reshaping the narrative of classical music through vibrantly
dynamic programming and wide-ranging interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>

<p>Their narrative programming style juxtaposes classical standards, new music, and their own
arrangements of familiar and forgotten works, fluidly interwoven and guided with speaking from
the Trio’s members. Their interdisciplinary collaborations include ongoing projects with dancer
Caroline Copeland, Sandglass Puppet Theater, chef David Bouley, and videographer Chris Kitchen.</p>

<p>In coming seasons, Merz Trio are looking forward to debuts at Merkin Hall in NYC, the Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. They have been encouraged
in their explorations by numerous institutional homes around the world, including the New
England Conservatory, Yellow Barn, Snape Maltings, Avaloch Farm Institute, the Naumburg
Foundation, the Lake Champlain, Olympic, and Chesapeake Music Festivals, and the Fischoff
Competition.</p>

<p>Merz Trio are represented by Concert Artists Guild and make their homes in Boston.</p>
