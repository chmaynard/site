<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/stephanie_zyzak.png" alt="Stephanie Zyzak" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Praised for her sensitive musicianship and heartfelt playing, violinist <a href="https://stephaniezyzak.com">Stephanie
Zyzak</a> is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the most
soulful and profound musicians of her generation.</p>

<p>At the age of seven, Stephanie made her first solo appearance with the Starling Chamber
Orchestra at the Aspen Music School and became the youngest recipient ever to be awarded the
Aspen Music School New Horizon Fellowship. The following year, she performed in Germany as
an invited guest of the Internationale Kunst – Akademie Liechtenstein (IKAL). Since making
her debut in 2004 with the Louisville Orchestra, Stephanie has performed as soloist
throughout Germany, Russia, Austria, Sweden, Spain, Italy, France, and with orchestras
including the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Dayton Philharmonic, Southeast Missouri
Symphony, and the UC Davis Symphony Orchestra. Recent and upcoming season highlights include
performances at Caramoor, Carnegie Hall, the Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concert series,
Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, and the Phillips Collection, among others.</p>

<p>A deeply passionate chamber musician, Stephanie has had the privilege of collaborating with
renowned musicians including Jonathan Biss, Kim Kashkashian, Ida Kavafian, Alice Neary,
Danny Phillips, Marcy Rosen, and Mitsuko Uchida. She has also performed at the Marlboro
Music Festival, Ravinia’s Steans Music Institute, Caramoor, the Four Seasons Chamber Music
Festival, as well as on tour with Musicians From Marlboro.</p>

<p>Born in South Carolina, Stephanie is a graduate of New England Conservatory where she
studied with Miriam Fried. Currently, she is studying at CUNY The Graduate Center with Mark
Steinberg. She is also a founding member of ensemble132, a roster-based chamber music
collective and was a 2020-22 Ensemble Connect fellow at Carnegie Hall.</p>

<p>Stephanie performs on a 1778 Joseph and Antonio Gagliano violin, generously on loan from
Ravinia’s Steans Music Institute, and a bow by François-Nicolas Voirin.</p>

<p>Since winning the First Prize and Audience Prize at the Telekom-Beethoven Competition in
Bonn in 2015 and the Borletti-Buitoni Trust Award in 2020, the career of Italian pianist

also performed with the Mozarteum Orchestra, Flanders Symphony Orchestra, Orchestra Verdi of
Milan, and many more, under conductors such as Jan Latham-Koenig, Claus Peter Flor, Andreas
Spering.</p>

<p>This season, Filippo has played recitals in the Paris Salle Cortot, Ravello Festival,
Festival Pianistico Brescia e Bergamo, and Ravenna Festival, and concertos with the Leonore
Orchestra, as well as several streamed recitals, and will join the Marlboro Chamber Music
Festival in the summer. He is also working on his project The Art of Fugue Explored, which
he presented internationally in a streamed concert for the Festival Bach Montreal from the
Mole Antonelliana, a national Italian landmark.</p>

<p>Filippo’s two albums, featuring Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations and Sonatas Opp 106 &amp; 111,
released on Alpha Classics, have garnered critical acclaim, including a Diapason d’Or Award
and 5-star reviews in The Guardian, BBC Music Magazine, Le Monde, Piano News and more.</p>

<p>After graduating with honours from the Donizetti Conservatory in Bergamo and completing a
Postgraduate Course at the Mozarteum University in Salzburg, Filippo continues his studies
with Maria Grazia Bellocchio and Pavel Gililov, and is mentored by Alfred Brendel.</p>
