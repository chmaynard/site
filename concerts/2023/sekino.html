<h3 id="yukiko-sekino">Yukiko Sekino</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/yukiko_sekino.png" alt="Yukiko Sekino" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Praised for her “thrilling, inspirational performance” (Florida Sun-Sentinel) and “elegance
of line, leaping energy” (San Jose Mercury News), pianist <a href="https://www.yukikosekino.com">Yukiko Sekino</a> 
has forged a career that encompasses a wide range of interests. A soloist noted for her
performances of Beethoven, Rachmaninoff, and Scriabin, she frequently collaborates in
chamber music and performs some of the most challenging twentieth and twenty-first century
works.</p>

<p>Sekino is the Gold Medalist of the 2006 International Russian Music Piano Competition and a
winner of the S&amp;R Foundation’s Washington Award. She has performed as a soloist with the
Boston Symphony Orchestra, New World Symphony, Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, and Stony Brook
Symphony Orchestra. Recital highlights have included the Jordan Hall in Boston, Overtures
Series in Washington, D.C., Dame Myra Hess Concerts in Chicago, Hitomi Memorial Hall in
Tokyo, Japan, Northeast Asia International Piano Festival in China, and U.S. college
campuses such as Eastman School of Music, MIT, and Ithaca College.</p>

<p>With an extensive repertoire spanning five centuries, Sekino has undertaken various
performance projects. Recent projects include performances of Chopin’s complete Op. 10 and
Op. 25 Etudes and the Four Ballades, late works by Alexander Scriabin, and world premieres
of compositions by David Rakowski and Ross Bauer. In 2023, she undertook a commissioning
project with support from the Mu Phi Epsilon Foundation. In this project, composers Mari
Kimura and Joseph Di Ponio wrote new works for piano and electronics for Sekino, taking
inspiration from the music of Scriabin and Debussy. Committed to the music of our times,
Sekino has performed as a soloist in major 20th century works such as Elliott Carter’s
Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano, Messiaen’s Oiseaux Exotiques, and Xenakis’ Eonta
and Palimpsest at venues including Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Theatre in Miami,
and Tanglewood Music Center.</p>

<p>Active as an educator, Sekino has given masterclasses at universities and conservatories in
the United States and serves as an adjudicator in various competitions. Her prize-winning
students regularly participate in festivals and competitions and continue further studies at
top schools. During the summers, she has been faculty and guest artist at East Carolina
Piano Festival, Atlantic Music Festival, and Northeast Asia International Piano Festival
(China). Having previously taught at Colby College, she is currently an Affiliate Artist at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and serves as piano faculty at New England
Conservatory Prep School and School of Continuing Education.</p>

<p>Sekino is a graduate of Harvard University and the Juilliard School and holds a doctoral
degree from State University of New York at Stony Brook. Her principal teachers were Gilbert
Kalish, Seymour Lipkin, and Robert Levin.</p>
