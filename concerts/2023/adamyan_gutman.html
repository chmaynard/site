<h3 id="diana-adamyan">Diana Adamyan</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/diana_adamyan.png" alt="Diana Adamyan" class="float-right" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dianaadamyanviolin.com">Diana Adamyan</a> is quickly gaining an international
reputation as one of her generation’s most outstanding violinists. After winning the First
Prize at the 2018 Yehudi Menuhin International Competition, the world’s most prestigious
prize for young violinists, she went on to receive First Prize in the 2020 Khachaturian
Violin Competition.</p>

<p>In Summer 2022, Ms. Adamyan made her debut at the Aspen Festival performing Dvorak with
Lionel Bringuier, and with the Boston Pops Orchestra performing Mendelssohn at Boston
Symphony Hall. Recent and upcoming engagements include recitals in Tokyo and France,
and her debut with the Deutsche Symphonie Orchester at the Philharmonie in Berlin.</p>

<p>Born in 2000 in Yerevan, Armenia, into a family of musicians, Ms. Adamyan currently studies
at the Munich University of Performing Arts with Ana Chumachenco, whose distinguished
students have included Lisa Batiashvili, Julia Fischer, and Veronika Eberle. Previously, she
studied at the Tchaikovsky School of Music (Yerevan) with Petros Haykazyan and at Yerevan
Komitas State Conservatory with Eduard Tadevosyan.</p>

<p>Ms. Adamyan is the recipient of a scholarship from the Deutsche Stiftung Musikleben and
under the patronage of the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) and “YerazArt”
organization in Boston. She performed on a violin crafted by Urs Mächler for the Menuhin
Competition, and now performs on an instrument made by Nicolò Gagliano in 1760, generously
on loan from the Henri Moerel Foundation.</p>

with violist Kim Kashkashian, violinist Miriam Fried, and clarinetist Charles Neidich. She tours
regularly with violinist Alexi Kenney, winner of Avery Fisher Grant.</p>

<p>A native of Israel, Renana started playing at the age of six, and soon after, garnered multiple
awards and honors. She received scholarships from the America Israel Cultural Foundation, and the

at Mannes College of Music, NY, where she studied with Richard Goode. In Israel, her teachers were
