<h2 id="about-the-artists">About the Artists</h2>

<h3 id="samuel-decaprio">Samuel DeCaprio</h3>

<p><img src="" alt="Samuel DeCaprio" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Currently a C.V. Starr Doctoral Fellow at The Juilliard School, cellist <a href="https://www.samdecaprio.com">Samuel
DeCaprio</a> is quickly establishing himself as one of today’s most
creative artists and collaborators. With performances taking place from the jungles of Bali to
the meditative depths of an underground New York City crypt to Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital
Hall, he aspires to use his voice to bring the works of composers, both revered and
underrepresented, to uplift modern audiences. Winner of the 2018 Aldo Parisot Prize from the
Yale School of Music, awarded to “gifted cellists who show promise for concert careers,” he
hopes to reach and inspire new listeners as an ambassador for classical music. Mr. DeCaprio was
a winner of the Wilmington Music Festival’s 2019-2020 Emerging Artist Auditions and is currently
on the Center for Musical Excellence Artist roster.</p>

<p>Mr. DeCaprio holds degrees from the University of Connecticut (Bachelor of Music, summa cum
laude), Eastman School of Music (Master of Music), Mannes School of Music (Professional Studies
Diploma), and Yale School of Music (Master of Musical Arts). While at the Eastman School, he was
also awarded the prestigious Performer’s Certificate. Mr. DeCaprio performs on a 1714 Claude
Pierray cello on generous loan from The Juilliard School.</p>

<h3 id="joanne-chang">Joanne Chang</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/joanne_chang.png" alt="Joanne Chang" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Malaysian pianist <a href="https://www.joannechangpiano.com">Joanne Chew-Ann Chang</a> has performed
internationally in North America, Europe, and Asia. She has been featured on distinguished
platforms including the Dame Myra Hess Concert Series (Chicago), International Menuhin Music
Academy (Switzerland), Music Academy of the West (Santa Barbara), and the National Youth
Orchestra of China (Beijing).</p>

<p>A dedicated pedagogue, Joanne balances between teaching and performing. She is a piano
faculty member at the Nightingale-Bamford School (New York) and recipient of the Morse
Teaching Fellowship at The Juilliard School. Joanne previouslu held teaching positions at
Indiana University and Florida State University.</p>

<p>Joanne holds a doctorate in Piano Performance and Literature with minors in Music Theory and
Arts Administration from the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. Joanne received a MM
degree in piano performance from Florida State University, and a BM (summa cum laude) in
piano performance from Kent State University, alongside an honors thesis publication on
French piano duet music. Joanne’s doctoral research document “The Bridge to Modernism: Franz
Liszt and the Late Piano Music” (2021) explores the connection of the composer’s late piano
works and the music of the early 20th century.</p>

<p>Joanne’s primary teachers include the late Karen Shaw, Jonathan Feldman, Read Gainsford,
Jerry Wong, Patricia Lim, and additional studies with Menahem Pressler and Olga Sitkovetsky.
An active collaborative pianist and teacher, Joanne is currently based in New York City as a
professional musician and Teaching Fellow in Piano and Music Theory at The Juilliard School
while pursuing a Graduate Diploma in Collaborative Piano as a recipient of the Kovner
Fellowship.</p>
