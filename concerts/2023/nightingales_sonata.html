<p>On Saturday, April  1, 2023 at 1:00 pm, 24 guests gathered for a special
concert presented in music, words, and photographs. With two acclaimed musicians and over
100 historical photographs, author Thomas Wolf presented the compelling story behind his
award-winning book, <a href="https://www.nightingalessonata.com"><em>The Nightingale’s Sonata</em></a>.</p>

<p>The tale took us from the shores of the Black Sea to the Tsar’s palace to Carnegie Hall to
the White House and beyond. In it, Wolf recounted the life of Lea Luboshutz, the first
internationally known female violinist, her incomparable Stradivarius violin (the
“Nightingale”), and her multi-generational musical family of which he is a member.  Against
the odds of pogroms, the Russian Revolution, and the Holocaust, this Jewish family triumphed
again and again.</p>

<p>The fascinating narrative told their personal stories while sketching the history of
classical music in the 20th century. Through the adversity they faced, family members were
linked by a remarkable piece of music, César Franck’s sonata for violin and piano, performed
live during the program.</p>
