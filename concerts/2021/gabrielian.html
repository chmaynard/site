<h3 id="tanya-gabrielian">Tanya Gabrielian</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/tanya_gabrielian.png" alt="Tanya Gabrielian" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>Hailed by the London Times as “a pianist of powerful physical and imaginative muscle,”
<a href="https://www.tanyagabrielian.com">Tanya Gabrielian</a> has captivated audiences worldwide with
her gripping performances. She has performed on four continents in acclaimed venues
including Carnegie Hall in New York, Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., Sydney Opera House,
Queen Elizabeth Hall and Wigmore Hall in London, and the Salle Cortot in Paris, with such
orchestras as the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Royal Scottish
National Orchestra, New London Sinfonia, and the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>

<p>Tanya shot onto the international stage at the age of twenty with back-to-back victories in
the Scottish International Piano Competition and Aram Khachaturyan International Piano
Competition. Since then, performance engagements have included Alice Tully Hall and the 92nd
Street Y in New York, Dame Myra Hess Concert Series in Chicago, Edinburgh International
Festival, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, and a return recital engagement at Wigmore Hall in
London. Tanya’s Southbank debut recital in the Purcell Room in London, presented by the
Philharmonia Orchestra, was chosen as “Performance of the Year” by Seen and Heard
International. She has also been featured on the cover of the magazine Clavier.</p>

<p>In addition to the traditional concert stage, Tanya is passionate about inspiring new
generations of musicians and music lovers in diverse settings, dedicated to community
engagement, education, and activism through art. Projects have included collaborations with
the National Alliance on Mental Illness in programs featuring composers with mental
illnesses, highlighting the stigma around mental health issues; founding an interactive
performance series for patients at the New York State Psychiatric Institute; an installation
with the artist Fran Bull for the exhibit In Flanders Fields: A Meditation on War; and a
multidisciplinary collaboration combining Haydn’s Seven Last Words of Our Savior on the
Cross with final statements from executed death row inmates. For her work, Tanya was awarded
the Pro Musicis International Award, McGraw-Hill Robert Sherman Award for Music Education
and Community Outreach, Salon de Virtuosi Career Grant, and the S&amp;R Washington Award, and
she has held Artist-in-Residencies at Guild Hall and 23Arts.</p>

<p>Tanya completed her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at the Royal Academy of Music in London,
originally studying both piano and viola. She received the prize for the best final recital
for all six years of study and received a DipRAM, the highest performance award given by the
Royal Academy of Music. Tanya then finished her studies at The Juilliard School as the only
candidate accepted for the prestigious Artist Diploma, an extraordinarily selective
post-graduate residency program. She has studied with Matti Raekallio, Ursula Oppens, Robert
McDonald, Hamish Milne, and Alexander Satz. Tanya is currently Chair of the Piano Department
at Boston University.</p>
