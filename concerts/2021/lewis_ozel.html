<h3 id="geneva-lewis">Geneva Lewis</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/geneva_lewis.png" alt="Geneva Lewis" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>New Zealand-born violinist <a href="https://www.genevalewisviolinist.com">Geneva Lewis</a> has forged a
reputation as a musician of consummate artistry whose performances speak from and to the
heart. Lauded for “remarkable mastery of her instrument” (CVNC) and hailed as “clearly one
to watch” (Musical America), Geneva is the recipient of a 2022 Borletti-Buitoni Trust Award,
2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant and Grand Prize winner of the 2020 Concert Artists Guild
Competition. Additional accolades include Kronberg Academy’s Prince of Hesse Prize, being
named a Performance Today Young Artist in Residence, and Musical America’s New Artist of the
Month. Most recently, Geneva was named one of BBC Radio 3’s New Generation Artists.</p>

<p>Since her solo debut at age 11 with the Pasadena POPS, Geneva has gone on to perform with
orchestras including the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, Pasadena Symphony, Sarasota Orchestra,
Pensacola Symphony and Duluth Superior Symphony Orchestra and with conductors including
Nicholas McGegan, Edwin Outwater, Michael Feinstein, Sameer Patel, Peter Rubardt, and Dirk
Meyer. The 2022-23 season includes performances with the Auckland Philharmonia, North
Carolina Symphony, Augusta Symphony, Kansas City Symphony, Austin Symphony and Arkansas
Symphony. In recital, recent and upcoming highlights include performances at Wigmore Hall,
Tippet Rise, Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, Washington Performing Arts, Merkin Hall,
and the Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concerts.</p>

<p>Geneva received her Artist Diploma and Bachelor of Music as the recipient of the Charlotte
F. Rabb Presidential Scholarship at the New England Conservatory, studying with Miriam
Fried. Prior to that, she studied with Aimée Kreston at the Colburn School of Performing
Arts. She is currently studying at Kronberg Academy with Professor Mihaela Martin. These
studies are funded by the Strauss Family Patronage. Past summers have taken her to the
Marlboro Music Festival, Ravinia Steans Institute, Perlman Music Program’s Chamber Workshop,
International Holland Music Sessions, Taos School of Music and the Heifetz International
Music Institute.</p>

<p>Geneva is currently performing on a composite violin by G.B. Guadagnini, c. 1766, generously
on loan from a Charitable Trust.</p>

<h3 id="evren-ozel">Evren Ozel</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/artists/evren_ozel.png" alt="Evren Ozel" class="float-right" /></p>

<p>American pianist <a href="https://www.evrenozel.com">Evren Ozel</a> has established himself as a
musician of “refined restraint” (Third Coast Review), combining fluent virtuosity with
probing, thoughtful interpretations. Having performed extensively in the United States and
abroad, Evren is the recipient of a 2023 Avery Fisher Career Grant, 2022 Salon de Virtuosi
Career Grant, and is currently represented by Concert Artists Guild as an Ambassador Prize
Winner of their 2021 Victor Elmaleh Competition.</p>

<p>Since his debut at age 11 with the Minnesota Orchestra, Evren has gone on to be a featured
soloist with the Cleveland Orchestra, Jacksonville Symphony, Boston POPS Orchestra, and The
Orchestra Now at Bard College with conductors including Jahja Ling, Courtney Lewis, Keith
Lockhart, and Leon Botstein.  In the 2023-24 season, he will record Mozart Concertos with
the Radio Symphonieorchester Wien and conductor Howard Griffiths.</p>

<p>Evren has performed solo recitals at important venues across the US, including The Gilmore’s
Wellspring Theater, the Harvard Musical Association, and the Ordway.  In 2021 he delivered
an all-Chopin recital under a joint collaboration between the Schubert Club and Chopin
Society of Minnesota, to critical acclaim.  In the 2023-24 season, Evren looks forward to
performing the last three Beethoven Sonatas in recital, as well as a recital debut in
Boston’s Jordan Hall.</p>

<p>Evren began learning piano from the Suzuki method in his hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota,
studying with Cindy Malmin. He later studied for seven years with Dr. Paul Wirth in
Minneapolis, and then moved to Massachusetts at age 15 to study with Wha Kyung Byun at the
Walnut Hill School for the Arts and the New England Conservatory Preparatory School. Evren
received his Bachelors and Masters degrees from the New England Conservatory and is
currently a candidate in their Artist Diploma program, all under the tutelage of Wha Kyung
Byun.  Other important mentors include Jonathan Biss, Imogen Cooper, Richard Goode, Dr.
Sarah Miller, Tom Rosenberg, and Mitsuko Uchida.</p>
